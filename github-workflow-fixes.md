# GitHub Workflow Fixes for BlockySpot

## Problem
The original GitHub workflow was failing with the error:
```
The system library `alsa` required by crate `alsa-sys` was not found.
```

This happened because the `librespot` dependency requires ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) libraries for audio functionality, but the GitHub Actions Ubuntu runner doesn't have these development libraries installed by default.

## Solution

### 1. **System Dependencies Installation**
Added a step to install the required system dependencies:
```yaml
- name: Install system dependencies (Ubuntu)
  if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y \
      libasound2-dev \
      pkg-config \
      libssl-dev \
      build-essential
```

**Key packages installed:**
- `libasound2-dev`: ALSA development libraries (fixes the main issue)
- `pkg-config`: Required for finding system libraries
- `libssl-dev`: SSL development libraries (needed for HTTPS connections)
- `build-essential`: Essential build tools (gcc, make, etc.)

### 2. **Multi-Platform Support**
Extended the workflow to support multiple operating systems:
- **Ubuntu**: Uses apt-get to install ALSA and other dependencies
- **macOS**: Uses brew to install pkg-config
- **Windows**: Uses built-in dependencies (no additional setup needed)

### 3. **Rust Version Management**
- Uses both `stable` and `beta` Rust versions for testing
- Excludes beta builds on Windows/macOS to reduce CI load
- Uses `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` for reliable Rust installation

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
Added comprehensive caching:
- Cargo registry cache
- Cargo git dependencies cache
- Build target cache

### 5. **Code Quality Checks**
- Formatting check with `cargo fmt`
- Linting with `cargo clippy`
- Security audit with `cargo audit`
- Only runs on stable Rust to avoid duplicate work

### 6. **Build Process**
Improved build process:
1. `cargo check` - Fast syntax and type checking
2. `cargo build` - Full compilation
3. `cargo test` - Run test suite

## Benefits

1. **Fixes the ALSA Error**: The main issue is resolved by installing `libasound2-dev`
2. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
3. **Fast**: Caching reduces build times significantly
4. **Reliable**: Uses stable Rust toolchain management
5. **Comprehensive**: Includes security auditing and code quality checks
6. **Maintainable**: Clear structure and conditional logic

## Usage

The workflow now automatically:
- Installs system dependencies based on the OS
- Caches dependencies for faster builds
- Runs on multiple Rust versions and platforms
- Performs security and quality checks
- Provides clear feedback on build status

This should resolve the original ALSA build failure and provide a robust CI pipeline for the BlockySpot project.
